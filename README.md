### 🌱 About Me
I began my data science journey with a drive to solve real-world problems through data. I enjoy uncovering insights, enabling data-driven decisions, and embracing emerging technologies. My projects aim to deliver end-to-end solutions that bring real business value.

### 🎯 Future Goals
As I continue to grow in my data science career, I aim to specialize in deep learning and artificial intelligence. I'm particularly excited about the potential of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to transform how we interact with and analyze data. My goal is to build innovative, intelligent systems that can improve decision-making processes and create more efficient solutions.
